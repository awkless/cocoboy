# COCOBOY

A sweet little gameboy emulator.

## Installation

You will need the following pieces of software:

- CMake [>= 3.25].
- C++17 compliant compiler.
- Conan [>= 2.0.0].

> __WARNING__
>
> If you barely installed Conan, then you need to generate a Conan
> profile with the following command: `conan profile detect --force`.

Perform the following steps if you are using a single configuration build
system:

```
# conan install . --build missing
# cmake --preset conan-release
# cmake --build --preset conan-release
# cmake --install build/Release
```
Preform the following steps if you are using a multi configuration build system
(mainly Windows MSVC):

```
# conan install . --build missing
# cmake --preset conan-default
# cmake --build --preset conan-release
# cmake --install build\Release
```
